# PyhtonEngineer
This repository contains a collection of Python learning projects created as part of my transition into a Python Engineer role. The projects focus on building strong programming fundamentals, writing clean and maintainable code, and solving practical problems using Python.

Each project is designed to reinforce core concepts such as control flow, functions, data structures, modular code design, and basic problem-solving patterns commonly tested in junior developer and entry-level engineering roles.
